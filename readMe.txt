1. Limitation in JSX :

    a. we need one containing element in render function
    b. we can't use class we should use className

2. Setting up JSX inorder to browsers can compile it:

    a. first go to setup part of babel.io
    b. add babel version in two place in index.html

3. Defining state field in the class (state is the object)
    state = {}

4. Using React developer tools in google chrome
